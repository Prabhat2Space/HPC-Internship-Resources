## HPC Internship - Placment Resourses and refrences  
**The motivation behind developing this document arises from a thorough review of the
information available on the Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology website,
particularly the reports submitted by the Artificial Intelligence Committees. It is evident that
each report presents significant insights and recommendations. Below is a concise summary of
the key findings from each committee report:**
'''
https://www.meity.gov.in/artificial-intelligence-committees-reports
'''
**1. Report of Committee A:
This report primarily focuses on platforms and data in Artificial Intelligence, providing
valuable insights into the development of a robust National Artificial Intelligence infrastructure.
It proposes strategies to enhance data accessibility and utilization, thereby facilitating accelerated
AI innovation and adoption.**
**2. Report of Committee B:
Committee B's report emphasizes the importance of leveraging Artificial Intelligence to
identify national missions across key sectors. It highlights potential areas where AI can drive
transformative impact, guiding policymakers in formulating targeted initiatives to address
societal challenges and foster economic growth.**
**3. Report of Committee C:
Committee C's report explores mapping technological capabilities and policy enablers
necessary for AI advancement. It emphasizes the significance of bolstering research capabilities
and skilling initiatives to support AI-based infrastructure development. Additionally, it stresses
the need for reskilling programs to equip the workforce with the requisite technical expertise to
thrive in AI-driven sectors.**
**4. Report of Committee D:
Committee D's report centers on cybersecurity, safety, legal, and ethical issues surrounding AI
deployment. It highlights cybersecurity threats and proposes strategies to mitigate risks, ensuring
the safe and ethical use of AI technologies. By addressing legal and ethical considerations, the
report aims to foster trust and confidence in AI systems.**

**Furthermore, upon examination of both the Report of Committee C and the NSM initiative,
which aims to cultivate an HPC-aware skilled workforce via Capability Building and integrate
cutting-edge emerging technologies at the grassroots level, alongside an analysis of the past five
years' annual reports of C-DAC (https://cdac.in/index.aspx?id=AnnualReports ), it becomes
evident that each report begins with an overview of India's HPC activity and the NSM
objectives. This underscores the government's steadfast commitment to NSM objective
fulfillment at every stage, demonstrating a high level of seriousness and dedication. As
beneficiaries of the NSM HPC CBP, our objective is to optimize outcomes from this initiative,
ultimately fostering a larger pool of intellectuals working in the HPC domain.
This document is currently being developed to support current and upcoming students
undergoing training under Capability Building programs. It encompasses comprehensive details
from open sources to assist them in pursuing careers in this domain. Additionally, it incorporates
major internships from global employers in the HPC domain, along with the criteria and
selection process for Indian Government and private R&D institutes working in the HPC
domain.**


**This document aims to extend support to both current and prospective students enrolled in
Capability Building programs. Its objectives include:**
'''
1. Providing comprehensive details from open sources to aid students in their pursuit of careers
within the domain.
2. Incorporating major internships from global employers in the HPC domain.
3. Outlining the criteria and selection process for Indian Government and private R&D institutes
engaged in the HPC domain.
